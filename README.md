# ScriptBucket
This is my personal script bucket where I keep scripts I need to download to different devices (e.g. a RPi)

## License

You are free to take any of these scripts free of charge. However I'd like you to make note of the MIT License under which my scripts are published. That means:

- You can use it in any project you want (even commercial ones)
- You can modify and republish the code.
- You can include it in projects with another license.

However you cannot:

- Hold me liable for anything that involves my scripts. (It is provided "as is"!)

You must:

- Include the copyright notice in places where it is needed
- Include a copy of the MIT license in your project (see therefore: [LICENSE]() License)
